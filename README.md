# Programming With Pictures

Using the camera, this control will allow you to add programming commands by holding up pieces of paper with images printed on them. The concept is to allow programming instructions using visual representations. Each card has an image that represents a specific command, such as move forward, turn right, turn left, or reverse. Using cue cards, the robot can be programmed for specific movements to navigate a maze, for example. The order in which the cards are shown to the robot are stored in memory and determines the path the robot will take. When you're ready to run the program, show the robot the Start card and the program will begin!
